|  Once the ZIP file has finished downloading, you can right click on the file to view the zip folder in your downloads.   |     |   
| Right click on the project ZIP folder that you have just downloaded and choose the option "**Copy To...**", then choose the location where you would like to save this folder.    |     |   
| Navigate to the final location where you have chosen to save the project folder.   |    |   
| To view the code itself, right click, choose "open with..." and open using a text editor such as VS Code or Atom, etc.   |     |
|  Once you have cloned or downloaded the project and opened it in VS Code or another text editor, open a new terminal by navigating to Terminal -> New Terminal. A terminal will open on the page.  |
